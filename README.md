On testing, no load, the robot is pullling 15A at 12V for all motors max speed. Further tests are needed, especially at battery voltage

Slippage occurs at about 12kg of static pull force. 

The robot can push 23kg easily under testing. It can pull it in a striaght line also. Poor on the turns. 

Robto weighs about 16.3kg at the moment
